### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2023

+ Projec title: "'Love' and 'Death' in Different Schools of Philosophy"
+ This project is conducted by Xinyu Zhu

+ Project summary: This project is about the analysis of the appearances of "love" and "death" in the sentences chosen from each philosophical school. We know that there are specific patterns when people speak, so there must also be patterns when philosophers write. Then I chose the words "love" and "death" to compare and analyze among different schools. After that, I created graphs and word clouds to visualize the different word patterns.
